<p><span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">Hi</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/jm1.png"></span></p>

<p id="left"> I neglected to mention how much I enjoyed the <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">Clarice Lispector</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/cl.jpg"></span> book as well. Though read it in spurts, and with absorption, then would put it down and forget everything.</p>

<p><span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">A Stream of life?</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/jm3.jpg"></span> That makes sense, the prose actually feels launched, volubly moving along. So more than modernist distress with closing the gap of form and content.</p>

<p id="left">Really curious, though I don't think I ever got a handle on it. But writing towards a present tense, and about a present-- both her present of writing, and our present in reading, reminded me of <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">Lyn Hejinian</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/lh.png"></span>.</p>

<p id="left">They both have these philosophical modes that are also plain spoken and funny.</p>

<p>Although Lispector writes more about the inadequacy of writing to relate the immediacy of thought ('the instant-now'), and the metaphor is always <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">flowing water</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/0017940.jpg"></span>.</p>

<p id="left">Whereas Hejinian is always playing around with the way language constructs, The <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">metonymy</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/m.jpg"></span> as a means of relating thought rather than the lyric and narrative tendencies of metaphor.</p>

<p>Just listened to this (kinda cute) analysis of part of <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">My Life</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/mylifecover.jpg"></span> , on the way up to my parents' house, deep in the triangle (ha) <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audioitem/4540">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audioitem/4540</a>.</p>

<p id="left">I like the ending, which I think works similarly to how you describe the <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">American Language Poetry</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/language.jpg"></span>.</p>

<p>The confluence of <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">longing</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/IMG_1101.jpg"></span>. we'll call it, and something formally determined is something I think about often, and aspire to.”</p>

<p id="left">There's this anecdote about <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">Donald Barthelme</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/db.jpg"></span> telling his class ‘We have a wacky mode. What must a wacky mode do? ...Break their hearts.”</p>

<p>Or from Lispector: <span class="container"> <span class="hover-text">"You gave me a ring of glass and then it broke and love ended."</span><img class="manImg" src="../assets/ring1.jpg"></span>.</p>
