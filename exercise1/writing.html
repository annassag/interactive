<input type="button" onclick="alert('Though read it in spurts, and with absorption, then would put it down and forget everything.')" value="I neglected to mention how much I enjoyed the Clarice Lispector book as well."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('That makes sense, the prose actually feels launched, volubly moving along. So more than modernist distress with closing the gap of form and content.')" value="A Stream of Life?"</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('Writing towards a present tense, and about a present â€“ both her present of writing, and our present in reading.')" value="Yes. Really curious, though I don't think I ever got a handle on it. It reminded me of Lyn Hejinian."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('Although Lispector writes more about the inadequacy of writing to relate the immediacy of thought (the instant-now).')" value="They both have these philosophical modes that are also plain spoken and funny."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('Whereas Hejinian is always playing around with the way language constructs.')" value="and the metaphor is always flowing water."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('The metonymy as a means of relating thought rather than the lyric and narrative tendencies of metaphor is interesting.')" value="Just listened to this (kinda cute) analysis of part of My Life, on the way up to my parents' house, deep in the triangle."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('The confluence of longing we will call it, and something formally determined is something I think about often, and aspire to, as seem Lispector and Hejinian.')" value="I like the ending, which I think works similarly to how you describe the American language poetry."</input><br><br>
<input type="button" onclick="alert('What must a wacky mode do?')" value="There's this anecdote about Donald Barthelme telling his class: We have a wacky mode,"</input><br><br>
